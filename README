Requirements
---
Tested on Ubuntu Linux, compatibility with other operating systems unknown.
Additionally, you should know that sendfile has a MAX FILE SIZE OF 1KB.



Installing
---
To prepare sendfile for use, you must make it executable:

$ chmod +x sendfile

Additionally, you may want to add it to your path.
This README will assume you have.



Using sendfile
---
Receiving a file:

To recieve a file, you must instruct sendfile to wait
for a connection on a certain port. For example, to wait 
on port 5000, you would, in a terminal, enter either:

$ sendfile --wait --port 5000
or
$ sendfile -w -p 5000


Sending a file:

To send a file, you must instruct sendfile to send
a certain filename to a specified address and port.
For example, to send a file named example.txt to 
address 127.0.0.1 on port 5000, you would, in
a terminal, enter either:

$ sendfile --send --file example.txt --address 127.0.0.1 --port 5000 
or
$ sendfile -s -f example.txt -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5000


Miscellaneous
---
To get verbose output when sending or recieving files,
use the -v or --verbose flag. This will give you step
by step output of the transfer process.
